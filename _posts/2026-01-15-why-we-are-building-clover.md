Online dating is broken. The most popular apps have optimized for engagement and revenue at the expense of actually matching people.

## The Problem

Swiping reduces people to split-second judgments. Algorithms keep you coming back without helping you find someone. Features are locked behind paywalls designed to exploit loneliness.

## Our Approach

We're building Clover to be different:

- **Deep compatibility matching** through questions that actually matter
- **Rich profiles** that let you get to know someone before messaging
- **No dark patterns** or addiction mechanics
- **Transparent match scores** based on values alignment

We believe technology has incredible potential to help people find each other. The current state of dating apps represents a gross misuse of that potential.

## What's Next

We're in active development and funded entirely by donations. No VCs, no investors, no compromises.
