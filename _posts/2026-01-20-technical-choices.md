A quick overview of the technologies powering Clover.

## Cross-Platform from Day One

We chose React Native + Expo so we can ship on iOS, Android, and web simultaneously. No "mobile-only" features, no crippled desktop experience.

## The Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React Native + Expo |
| Language | TypeScript |
| UI | React Native Paper |
| Backend | Supabase |
| Database | PostgreSQL |

## Why Supabase?

Supabase gives us:

- PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security
- Built-in authentication
- Realtime subscriptions for messaging
- File storage for photos

All without managing infrastructure ourselves.

## Open Development

Our [branding assets](https://github.com/Clover-Dating/branding) are public. The main app will remain private during development, but we're committed to transparency about our approach.

More technical deep-dives coming soon.
